As a natural language processing developer,
I need a user story completion report generator,
so that I can detect if all the user stories are implemented.

Acceptance Criteria:

A method/application to verify all user stories are complete exists and
the application parses the user stories and
the user stories are denoted with the '.story' file extension and
a user story is considered complete if it contains an 'ACCEPTED' marker in its text.

-*=ACCEPTED=*-
