As a natural language processing developer,
I need to detect dates 
so that the interview bot informs users what happened and who was born on the date detected.

Acceptance Criteria

A service method exists to detect dates contained in input text and 
the application asks the user a date that interests them and
the app records the date and
the app informs the user of other events that occurred on the given date and
the app lets users know who in history has the date as their birthday.
