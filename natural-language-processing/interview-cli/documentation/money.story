As a natural language processing developer,
I need to detect how much a user would pay for an item,
so that the app can recommend a product within the user's budget

Acceptance Criteria:

A money/currency detection service method exists and
the app asks the user what product they like and 
the app asks the user what budget amount they have for shopping and 
the app recommends items within that budget.
