As a natural language processing developer,
I need to detect how much money they have for their project,
so that the app can recommend a product within the user's budget

Acceptance Criteria:

A money/currency detection service method exists and
the app asks the user what budget amount they have for their project and 
the app recommends project items within that budget.
