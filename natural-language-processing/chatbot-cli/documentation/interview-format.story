As a chatbot,
I need to communicate with the user in interview format,
so that I know all questions to determine when the interview is complete.

Acceptance Criteria:

The application communicates with the user by asking questions in interview format and
the app records responses and 
interview instances accept a final list of all questions when constructed,
the interview continues until all questions are answered and
the interview is complete once all questions are answered.
