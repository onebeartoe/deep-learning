As a natural language processing developer,
I need a user story completion unit test,
so that I can detect if all the user stories are implemented

Acceptance Criteria:

A unit test exists to parse the user stories and
the user stories are denoted with the '.story' file extension and
a user story is considered complete if it contains '-*=ACCEPTED=*-' in its text.
