As a natural language processing developer,
I need to detect the user's language from an interview response,
so that I can continue with the interrogation or let her know the chatbot is 
    not able to continue in their language.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given a text blurb the application can detect its language and
the language detection is based on the users response to the 'how are you doing?' question.
