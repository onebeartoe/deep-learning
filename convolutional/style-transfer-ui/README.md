This application adds a GUI to the style transfer convolutional neural network found 
in the DeepLearning4J examples.

For more information see the project page:

http://onebeartoe.org/software/development/deep-learning/convolutional/style-transfer/

Usage: Select a content image, select a style image, then click the 'Apply Style' 
button.  Once the processing completes, the 'please wait' dialog closes.  The output 
images are placed alongside the content image under a directory named 'styled'.
